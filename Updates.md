# Aspire updates

What's changed with the new versions of .NET Aspire?

With all the chapters (with the exception of chapter 1) we now use **NuGet Central Package Management (CPM)** with package versions specified in the file *Directory.Packages.props'. This makes it easier to update all chapters.
In case you copy the content of just a single chapter, also copy the file *Directory.Packages.props* from the root folder to get all the projects compiled.

## .NET Aspire 9.1 Updates

Azure Cosmos DB:

App-Model: `AddDatabase` --> `AddCosmosDatabase`

Azure Event Hub

App-Model: `AddEventHub` --> `AddHub`

## .NET Aspire 9.0 Updates

### Chapter 1, Introdution to .NET Aspire and Microservices

#### Page 4, Starting with .NET Aspire:

The *Aspire workload* is no longer required with Aspire 9. Instead, the Aspire SDK is specified with the AppHost project file:

```xml
 <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.0.0" />
```

#### Page 7, The app model with the generated code:

```csharp
builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireSample_Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithReference(apiService)
    .WaitFor(apiService);
```

The WaitFor method is new with .NET Aspire 9 which allows waiting with the start of the webfrontend until the apiService has been started.

#### Page 13, .NET Aspire integrations

*.NET Aspire components* have been renamed to *.NET Aspire integrations*

### Chapter 11, Logging and Monitoring

With the `Activity` class, recording exceptions has been renamed from `RecordException` to `AddException`.
